NOTE: This project is currently incomplete but still active.  

This program utilizes the following libraries:
-csv
-numpy (Currently not implemented but will be in future updates)

The goal of this project is to create a convolutional neural network without 
the use of libraries such as TensorFlow or Theano.  The purpose of this is to 
develop a fundamental understanding of process behind convolutional neural 
networks.

The mnist dataset must downloaded and placed in the resources folder in order
to run.
