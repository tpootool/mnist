This program utilizes the following libraries:
-csv
-numpy

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning algorithm without 
the use of libraries such as TensorFlow or Theano.  The purpose of this is to 
develop a fundamental understanding of process behind convolutional neural 
networks.

Currently this project is incompleted but still active.  

The mnist dataset must downloaded and placed in the resources folder in order
